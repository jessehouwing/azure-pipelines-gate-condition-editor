To run you must have one of the following prerequisites installed:

 * Team Foundation Server 2018 update 1 or later
 * [Azure DevOps Server 2019 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
 
It is not required to actually configure the server, so no need for SQL Server, IIS or anything. Just run the installer and cancel the configuration wizard.
